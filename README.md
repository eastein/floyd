# Is There Anybody In There?

Given the info needed to join an IRC channel, answer the !people trigger with the list of nicks who are connected from the same hostname/ip as the bot.  Obviously, this is defeated by host masks, sneaky vhosts, people using BNCs, people using shells, and a billion other things. It's just *handy*, ok?
